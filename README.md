<h1>🚀 Exciting Encryption and Password Cracking Utility 🚀<h1/>

Hello Everyone! Today, we've got an incredible piece of code to share with you. This powerful utility allows you to perform text-to-hash conversions, hash cracking, and even dictionary attacks. Let's dive into it!

**🔐 Text to Hash Conversion**
Are you looking to convert plain text into a secure hash? You're in the right place! This tool supports multiple hash types, including MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256. Just follow the prompts to enter your text and choose the hash type, and voila, you'll get the hashed result.

**🧐 Dictionary Attack**
If you have a hashed password and you want to crack it using a dictionary attack, this tool can help. Select the hash type, specify the path to your dictionary file (e.g., "Hacking_Tools\DictionaryAttack\data\1MillionPassword.txt"), and enter the hashed password. Our utility will do the heavy lifting to find the original password for you.

**💻 How to Use:**
Run the code.
Choose "E" for text-to-hash conversion or "D" for dictionary attack.
Follow the prompts and provide the necessary information.
